The propagation Internet worms has been historically modeled using formulaic techniques.  While these approaches yield results that do match historical trends, they frequently make significant generalizations about network topology (e.g. uniform link speeds, no inaccessible sub-networks).  A simulation-based approach may yield insight into certain behaviors not observed with prior approaches.  Accordingly, this project takes a simulation-oriented approach using map/reduce to model Internet worm propagation.
